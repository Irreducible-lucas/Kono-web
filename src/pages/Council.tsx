              Success in the development of our district is determined by
              working together to deliver strategic initiatives and build
              organizational excellence. To influence development for Kono
              District, we require a diverse skillset and an empowered team
              working towards a common goal. The Councilâ€™s organisational
              excellence is achieved by leading with humility, integrity and
              professionalism, maintaining a district-wide focus, being
              strategic and effective, and using well-developed evidence to
              advocate for our district.
